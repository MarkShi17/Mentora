# Brain System & Multimodal RAG Implementation

## Overview

Implemented a specialized brain system with multimodal RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation) using ChromaDB for intelligent routing and memory.

## What Was Implemented

### 1. Brain System (`lib/agent/brainRegistry.ts`)
- **Math Brain**: Specialized for mathematical concepts with Manim animations
- **Biology Brain**: Specialized for biological diagrams and scientific visualizations
- **Code Brain**: Specialized for programming and algorithms
- **Design Brain**: Specialized for UI/UX and visual design
- **General Brain**: Flexible general-purpose teaching

Each brain has:
- Specific capabilities and strengths
- Associated MCP tools
- Custom prompt enhancements

### 2. Brain Selector (`lib/agent/brainSelector.ts`)
- Uses Claude Haiku (fast & cheap) to intelligently select the best brain
- Considers question content, context, and recent topics
- Fallback to keyword-based selection if AI selection fails
- Returns confidence score and reasoning

### 3. Multimodal RAG (`lib/memory/multimodalRAG.ts`)
- ChromaDB-based memory storage and retrieval
- Stores questions, answers, concepts, and visualizations
- Retrieves relevant past context for current questions
- Extracts searchable content from canvas objects
- Filters memories by session, brain type, and tags

### 4. Integration with Mentor Agent
- Brain selection happens before generating response
- Memory retrieval provides relevant past context
- Brain-specific prompt enhancements guide the AI
- Memories are stored after successful responses

## How It Works

### Example: Math Question

1. **Question**: "Explain the Pythagorean theorem"
2. **Brain Selection**: Math Brain (confidence: 0.95)
   - Reasoning: "Mathematical concept requiring visual proof"
3. **Memory Retrieval**: Finds past conversations about triangles
4. **Enhanced Prompt**: Includes math brain instructions + relevant memories
5. **Response**: Uses Manim to create animated proof
6. **Storage**: Saves question, answer, and visualization to memory

## API Endpoints

### GET /api/brain/status
Returns information about all available brains and their capabilities.

## Configuration

### Environment Variables
```bash
# ChromaDB (optional - falls back gracefully if not available)
CHROMADB_URL=http://localhost:8000
```

## Benefits

1. **Specialization**: Each brain is optimized for its domain
2. **Context Awareness**: RAG provides relevant past context
3. **Intelligent Routing**: AI automatically selects the best brain
4. **Memory**: Conversations build a knowledge base over time
5. **Flexibility**: Falls back gracefully if ChromaDB unavailable

## Status

✅ Brain system fully implemented
✅ Brain selector working
✅ RAG system integrated
✅ Memory storage working
⚠️ ChromaDB requires setup for production use

## Next Steps

1. Set up ChromaDB server for production
2. Add more specialized brains as needed
3. Fine-tune brain selection prompts
4. Add memory pruning for old conversations
