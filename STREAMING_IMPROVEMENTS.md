# Streaming Improvements Summary

## Changes Made

### 1. Event-Based Streaming Format
- Changed from JSON to event-based markers for better streaming
- Text streams token-by-token immediately with `[NARRATION]` markers
- Objects generate progressively with `[OBJECT_START]`, `[OBJECT_CONTENT]`, `[OBJECT_END]` markers
- Much faster initial response time

### 2. Voice Agent Fixed
- Fixed TTS audio generation issue (was checking for non-existent `success` property)
- Audio chunks now properly generated and sent for each sentence
- Voice synthesis working correctly with OpenAI TTS

### 3. Visual Indicators Added
- Chat history now shows "..." while streaming is ongoing
- Shows ðŸ”Š emoji when audio is playing
- Automatically removes indicator when streaming completes
- Provides clear feedback about generation state

### 4. Progressive Object Generation
- Added `GenerationState` type to CanvasObject ('generating', 'complete', 'error')
- Created `ObjectLoadingState` component with animated loading indicator
- Objects show loading state while content is being generated
- Smooth replacement when object content is ready

### 5. Implementation Details

#### Backend Changes:
- Modified `streamingOrchestrator.ts` to use event-based format
- Fixed audio result check (removed `audioResult.success` check)
- Added proper logging for audio generation
- System prompt updated to use streaming format

#### Frontend Changes:
- Updated `prompt-bar.tsx` to show streaming indicators
- Modified `object-layer.tsx` to display loading states
- Enhanced `use-streaming-qa.ts` hook to handle progressive updates
- Added proper generation state handling

#### Type Updates:
- Added `GenerationState` type to canvas types
- Added `placeholder` and `label` fields to CanvasObject
- Updated object generator to include labels

## Testing

The streaming improvements provide:
- âœ… Immediate text response (starts streaming right away)
- âœ… Voice synthesis working (audio chunks generated for each sentence)
- âœ… Visual feedback during generation (shows "..." or ðŸ”Š)
- âœ… Progressive object loading (placeholders â†’ complete objects)
- âœ… Better user experience with clear generation states

## Performance Improvements

- **Response Time**: Text starts appearing immediately instead of waiting for full JSON
- **Voice Latency**: Audio generates sentence-by-sentence for faster playback
- **Visual Feedback**: Users always know when content is generating
- **Object Loading**: Progressive loading prevents UI blocking

## Usage

The improvements are automatic and work with the existing streaming QA endpoint:
- Text appears word-by-word in chat history
- Voice plays as soon as each sentence is ready
- Objects show loading animation while generating
- Chat history indicates ongoing generation with "..."
