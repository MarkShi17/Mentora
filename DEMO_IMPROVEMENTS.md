# Demo Session Improvements

## Changes Made

### 1. ✅ Removed Tech Stack Box
The Technology Stack object has been removed from the demo session to streamline the presentation.

**Updated Object Count:**
- **Before**: 8 objects (1 intro + 3 architecture + 4 features)
- **After**: 7 objects (1 intro + 2 architecture + 4 features)

### 2. ✅ Added Staggered Animation Delays

Objects now reveal sequentially with a cascading effect instead of appearing all at once.

**Animation Timing:**
- **First object**: Appears immediately (0ms delay)
- **Second object**: Appears after 150ms
- **Third object**: Appears after 300ms
- **Fourth object**: Appears after 450ms

This creates a smooth, professional "cascading" reveal effect that looks much cooler!

## Current Demo Structure

### Trigger 1: "What are you?"
Reveals **2 objects** with staggered animation:
1. **Architecture Overview** (0ms delay)
2. **How It Works** (150ms delay)

### Trigger 2: "What are your features?"
Reveals **4 objects** with staggered animation:
1. **Key Features** (0ms delay)
2. **Use Cases** (150ms delay)
3. **Teaching Modes** (300ms delay)
4. **Try It Now** (450ms delay)

## Tree Layout

Objects now appear in a clean tree structure with proper spacing:

```
[Main Title] ───────> [Architecture]      (appears at 0ms)
   (80h)                    |
                            | 150px gap
                            ↓
                       [How It Works]      (appears at 150ms)
                            |
                            |
                       [Key Features]      (appears at 0ms)
                            |
                            | 150px gap
                            ↓
                       [Use Cases]         (appears at 150ms)
                            |
                            | 150px gap
                            ↓
                       [Teaching Modes]    (appears at 300ms)
                            |
                            | 150px gap
                            ↓
                       [Try It Now]        (appears at 450ms)
```

## Spacing Settings

**Horizontal Spacing**: 500px
- Distance from source object to revealed objects
- Ensures clean separation left-to-right

**Vertical Spacing**: 150px
- Gap between vertically stacked objects
- Prevents any overlap even with tall objects

## Visual Effect

The cascading reveal creates a "building" effect:
1. User asks question
2. Connection line appears to first object
3. First object fades in
4. 150ms pause
5. Connection line appears to second object
6. Second object fades in
7. (Repeat for remaining objects)

This gives a sense of the AI "thinking" and "generating" each component, making the demo feel more dynamic and impressive!
